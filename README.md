How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following:
Math and reading scores by grade
Scores by school spending

Summary: Summarize four changes in the updated school district analysis after reading and math scores for the ninth grade at Thomas High School have been replaced with NaNs.

  The purpose of the school district analysis was to develop insight on student test performance in order to make adjustments for next years school district budget allocation. Jupyter Notebook is a powerful tool that allowed to view the school districts test results to make comparisons between schools. School type, total student population for each school, total budgets, budget per student, math scores, reading scores, percentage of students who passed math only, reading only or both, spending ranges per student, and school size were the focus of this module. With the provided data, we can look at trends of a schools performance based on: school size, type, and spending. In this challenge the test results of the 9th grade class of Thomas High School were omitted due to potential academic dishonesty.

The results of the omitted 9th grade class of Thomas high school produced interesting results:

district summary results post NaN



Paradoxilly, we can see an increase in %passing math, reading, and overall % passing. Overall, with the omitted 9th grade class of Thomas High School, performance for the rest of the school increased.
